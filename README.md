# The Power of Plots

The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens and generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study.

It was observed that some of the mice had duplicate IDs and hence the data was cleaned by removing all duplicates and an analysis was done on that which provided the following:
a summary statistics table containing the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen

Also a calculation of the final tumor volume for each mouse across the four most promising treatment regimens showed capomulin and ramicane as the most effective regimens with their tumor volumes being the lowest among the drug regimens.

There is a also strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
