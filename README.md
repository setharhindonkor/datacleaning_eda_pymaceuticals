# The Power of Plots

The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens and generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study.

It was observed that some of the mice had duplicate IDs and hence the data was cleaned by removing all duplicates before proceeding to the exploratory data analysis and regression.

The integrated dat from multiple sources was queried and visualized via the use of histograms, bar plots, pie charts, boxplots, scatter plots) to identify relationships among the data.

A summary statistics table containing the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen was obtained.

A calculation of the final tumor volume for each mouse across the four most promising treatment regimens showed capomulin and ramicane as the most effective regimens with their tumor volumes being the lowest among the drug regimens.

There is a also strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
